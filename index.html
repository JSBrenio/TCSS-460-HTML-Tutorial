            This is a link template to a CSS file that will style the HTML page.
            From the MDN documentation:
            The <link> element should always go inside the head of your document. 
            This takes two attributes, rel="stylesheet", 
            which indicates that it is the document's stylesheet, and href, 
            which contains the path to the stylesheet file:
        -->

        <!--
            <script src="my-js-file.js" defer></script>
            This is a link template to a JavaScript file that will add interactivity to the HTML page.
            From the MDN documentation:
            The <script> element should also go into the head, 
            and should include a src attribute containing the path to the JavaScript you want to load, and defer, 
            which basically instructs the browser to load the JavaScript after the page has finished parsing the HTML. 
            This is useful as it makes sure that the HTML is all loaded before the JavaScript runs, 
            so that you don't get errors resulting from JavaScript trying to access an HTML element that doesn't exist on the page yet. 
            There are actually a number of ways to handle loading JavaScript on your page, but this is the most reliable one to use for modern browsers

                A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, 
                also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
                Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. 
                The title contains additional information about the link, 
                such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.
