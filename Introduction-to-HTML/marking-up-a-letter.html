        <!--
        In modern HTML5, you should avoid using the trailing slash on void elements, 
        as it's unnecessary and doesn't provide any functional benefits. 
        Instead, use <br> instead of <br />. If you're working with older XHTML or need to comply with it, then you'd use the slash (<br />).

        <!--
        <div>: This is a block-level element. 
            It takes up the full width available (as much as the parent container allows) 
            and starts on a new line, pushing any other content to the next line.
        <span>: This is an inline element. 
            It only takes up as much width as its content requires and does not start on a new line, 
            so other content can flow alongside it.
        <br>: This is a line break element, used to create a line break in text. 
            It is an empty element, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag.
            Do not use <br> to create margins between paragraphs; 
            wrap them in <p> elements and use the CSS margin property to control their size.

        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your 
            <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

        <h2>Starting dates</h2>

        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

        <!--
            <ul>: This is an unordered list element, used for lists of items that don't have a specific order.
                <li>: This is a list item element, used to represent an item in a list.
            <time>: This is a time element, used to represent dates and times in a machine-readable format. 
                It can be used to represent the date and time of an event, the duration of a video, 
                or the time at which a blog post was published, among other things.
        -->
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

        <!--
        <a>: This is an anchor element, 
            used to create hyperlinks to other 
            web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or any other URL.

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

        <!--
        <ol>: This is an ordered list element, used for lists of items that have a specific order.
        <sub>: This is a subscript element, used to display text slightly below the normal line of text. 
            It is often used in chemical formulas or mathematical expressions.
        <sup>: This is a superscript element, used to display text slightly above the normal line of text. 
            It is often used for footnotes, exponents, or ordinal indicators.
        <u>: This is an underline element, used to underline text. 
            It is generally used for stylistic purposes, but should be used sparingly as it can be confused with hyperlinks.
        -->
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><u><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></u> and <u><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>


        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

        <!--
        <dl>: This is a description list element, used for lists of terms and their descriptions.
            <dt>: This is a term element, used to represent a term in a description list.
                <dd>: This is a description element, used to represent the description of a term in a description list.
        -->
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300
                    <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
