    <body>

    <!--
    <main> is for content unique to this page. Use <main> only once per page, and put it directly inside <body>. 
        Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.

    <article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
        
    <section> is similar to <article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page 
        that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), 
        or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break <article>s 
        up into different <section>s, or <section>s up into different <article>s, depending on the context.

    <aside> contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information 
        indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
    <header> represents a group of introductory content. 
        If it is a child of <body> it defines the global header of a webpage, 
        but if it's a child of an <article> or <section> it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).

    <nav> contains the main navigation functionality for the page. 
        Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
        
    <footer> represents a group of end content for a page.
